# Hangman-Game
bootcamp HW 3

The game "Hanged Man" is made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, playable in any browser. It takes in user keyboard input to guess letters in a word, and displays the correct letters as well as the incorrect letters. After 12 attempts, the game resets with a new word. The page will log wins and losses for as long as the user is on the page. It will refresh on user refresh.

I used Soundcloud to play select music from the Shin Megami Tensei: Persona series, a series that I'm playing a lot lately. The words in the list are loosely related to the game. I embedded a player from soundcloud to play just a couple of songs. When the player wins a game or loses a game, the background changes.
